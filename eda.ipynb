Its ultimate purpose is to advance the theory of forecasting and improve its utilization by business and non-profit organizations. Its other goal is to compare the accuracy/uncertainty of ML and DL methods vis-Ã -vis those of standard statistical ones, and assess possible improvements versus the extra complexity and higher costs of using the various methods.</blockquote>\n","\n","The dataset consists of five seperate 'csv' files which contain all of the data offered for the competition.
